%%  vectors and matrices
A = [1 2; 3 4; 5 6]
v = [1 2 3]
v = [1; 2; 3]
v = 1:0.1:2   % from 1 to 2, with stepsize of 0.1. Useful for plot axes
v = 1:6       % from 1 to 6, assumes stepsize of 1 (row vector)

C = 2*ones(2,3) % same as C = [2 2 2; 2 2 2]
w = ones(1,3)   % 1x3 vector of ones
w = zeros(1,3)
w = rand(1,3) % drawn from a uniform distribution 
w = randn(1,3)% drawn from a normal distribution (mean=0, var=1)
w = -6 + sqrt(10)*(randn(1,10000));  % (mean = -6, var = 10) - note: add the semicolon
I = eye(4)   % 4x4 identity matrix
